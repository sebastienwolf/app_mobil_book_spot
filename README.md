# Expo Router Example

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

## 🚀 How to use

```sh
npx create-expo-app -e with-router
```

## 📝 Installation  
  
- npm install  
- npx expo start  
- Change the api url in this file https://github.com/sebastienwolf/app_mobil_book_spot/blob/7978687debda6ca67fdf466c6d4184b8ecde2888/src/core/request/Request.js#L6  
  
  
## 📝 API

## 📝 expo publish   
(The api link changes every time I relaunch the ngrock server for my api, so it's not really operational without launching the api and changing it in the code before doing an "npx expo publish")
